<h3>Loyalty and Security</h3>
	Region Loyalty starts at 1. Giving it a Luxury adds 3. Giving a Province a Luxury gives 1 to every Region in it.<br/>
	At 5 Loyalty, it produces an extra Resource. If at least half of a Province's Regions have this, the Province gets +1 Security.<br/>
	At 10 Loyalty, it produces an additional extra Resource. If at least half the Province's Regions have this, the Province gets another +2 Security.

	Spy Actions against other Regions are a Contested Risk of your <b>Espionage Action Rank vs. the Province Security</b>.<br/>
	<b>Espionage Action Rank</b> = Spy Network Rank + Helper Rank. You can assign yourself, your Spouse, or your Spy Master as a helper if you wish.<br/>
	<b>Province Security</b> = the Rank of the Spy Network assigned to it. Their Season Action may be used to double that.<br/><br/>
	<b>Vassal Loyalty</b> = Vassal Rank + Yearly Luxury Bonus
