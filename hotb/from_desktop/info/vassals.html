<h3>Villages and Craftsmen</h3>
<p>
	Rank 1 Villages have a Craftsman. He is equal in Rank to the village, so when the village is expanded the Craftsman increases in Rank as well. He also cannot be trained up in Ranks, you must increase the village Rank instead.<br/>
	When the Craftsman goes to work, you get his Rank in points to distribute amongst goods. For example, a Rank 3 Craftsman can make three Rank 1 Goods, a Rank 1 and a Rank 2, or one Rank 3. That will keep him occupied a number of Seasons equal to the highest Rank among the items he's crafting.<br/>
	Expanding a Village costs 1 Lumber and 1 Stone. At Rank 3 you can expand it to a City for 3 Lumber, 3 Stone, and 3 Luxuries.<br/>
	Once a Village becomes a City it may house one Rank 1, one Rank 2, one Rank 3, and one Rank 4 Craftsman.

<h3>Bands and Masters</h3>
<p>
	Vassals come in two types representing groups of people and leaders. You can have a great Spy Network, but when they're Rank 3 they'll need a Spy Master to get better.<br/>
	While groups can be bribed, they can't be assassinated. The opposite is true for masters, they can be assassinated but not bribed.<br/>
	To help you figure out which Vassals have prerequisites, I've grouped them in the following table:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Bands</th>
			<th>Masters</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Artisan</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Caravan</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Apothecary</td>
			<td></td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Court Scholar</td>
			<td></td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Craftsman</td>
			<td></td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Herald</td>

		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Maid/Valet</td>
			<td></td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Secret Army</td>
			<td>General</td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Roadmen*</td>
			<td>Master of the Road</td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Spy Network*</td>
			<td>Master Spy</td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="color: #666;"><i>a city</i></td>
			<td>Mayor</td>
		 </tr>
		<tr>
			<td>Personal Guard*</td>
			<td></td>
		 </tr>
		 <tr>
		 	<td>Staff</td>
		 	<td>Seneschal</td>
		 </tr>
	</table>
<br/>
* There are 10 men in this group for every Rank.<br/><br/>
