		<td>Bear</td>
		<td>
		The embodiment of self-determination, 
the Blooded of the Bear live alone in the 
mountains. They are not isolationists, nor do 
they shun the company of their cousins, but 
prefer to remain above such petty matters 
as politics. Stories paint caricatures 
of Bears as boorish and loud, disregarding 
tradition and fashion, but they can also be 
duplicitous as the most crafty Elk or Serpent.
The Blooded of the Bear can use intrigue to 
solve matters, but prefer to deal with such 
issues up front, in the open, and with brutal 
honesty. The virtue the Bear value above 
all others is <b>Strength</b>. The ability 
to stand alone.

		<td>Elk</td>
		<td>
		The Elk are a shunned House, but their 
banner has not yet been veiled. Once the 
most powerful House, the Blooded of the 
Elk were nearly stripped of their lands and 
titles. If not for the precious favours they 
traded to keep their status, the Elk would 
be no more. Now, their banner sits half-
veiled in the Senate, a symbol of their shame. 
But they are still one of the most powerful 
Houses, masters of politics and intrigue. 
Moving their influences from sight, they 
are the most subtle manipulators, regaining 
their Strength and glory one maneuver at 
a time. The virtue of the Elk is <b>Cunning</b>.
To plot, to plan, and to execute.

		<td>Falcon</td>
		<td>
		After the fall of the Empire, the Blooded of 
the Falcon gave up their lands to wander 
the world. “We have lost our way,” the Grand 
Earl of the Falcon declared, veiling his own 
banner. And for many years, the Blooded of 
the Falcon were gone. Five years ago, they 
returned, reclaiming their lands in daring 
raids and sieges. The grandson of the man 
who veiled their colors took the black from 
their heraldry, declaring their return. Of all 
the Houses, the Falcon have the closest bond 
with the common folk and are most familiar 
with the ways of the Road. The virtue the 
Falcon reveres is <b>Courage</b>. To 
maintain virtue above all temptations.

		<td>Arcel</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Serpent</td>
		<td>
		Mysterious servant of the underworld, he 
is a symbol of knowledge… and the price it 
carries. The Blooded of the Serpent know 
this price. They have paid it well. And now, 
they wield the benefit. The House of the 
Serpent are keepers of all manner of esoteric 
knowing, including mastery of the forbidden 
Blood magic of the sorcerer-kings. If you 
want to know a secret, the best place to start 
is with the Serpent… but be prepared to pay. 
The virtue the Serpent reveres is <b>Wisdom</b>. To 
suffer painful knowledge.

		<td>Sercon</td>

	<tr>
		<td>Fox</td>
		<td>
		With voices like choirs, they announce 
their arrival. The Blooded of the Fox are 
the shining jewels of the court. They are 
masters of all the Arts, but they are best 
known for the fine Art of seduction. Music 
and Romance are in their Blood and they 
ache to share their Arts… but only with 
you. Of course, only with you. The virtue 
the Fox reveres is <b>Beauty</b>. To 
bring sublime majesty to all things.

		<td>Vulorma</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Wolf</td>
		<td>
		“Are you tool or weapon?” This is the 
question the Blooded of the Wolf ask their 
children. Just before they throw them into 
the pit. Brutal taskmasters, the House 
of the Wolf does not suffer those who 
show weakness. All their lives, they study 
strategy and tactics, learning the subtle 
Art of advantage. They are taught to see 
strength and weakness in all situations, for 
in the eyes of the Wolf, every moment is 
war. The virtue the Wolf reveres is <b>Prowess</b>.
To find advantage.
