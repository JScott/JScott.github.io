		<h2>Phases</h2>
		<div id="phases">
		<p>
			While creating a character, you won’t just look at who he is, but you’ll 
also take a look at who he was. 
		<p>
		</p>
			Your character’s past is told in a series of Phases. A Phase represents 
a certain amount of time in your character’s past. Each character has 4 Phases: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Solace.
		<p>
		</p>
			Each Phase is different, representing a different time in your 
character’s life. The more Phases you choose for your character, 
the older your character becomes. Age brings advantages but also 
carries the weight of certain disadvantages.
		<p>
		</p>
			For each Phase, your character gets Aspects and Contacts.
		</p>
		<br/>
			<div class="col1">
			<h3>Aspects</h3>
			<p>
				You get two Aspects.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aspects  are words, phrases or even quotes that help define your 
	character. They are the keywords you use to describe not only who
	your character is, but what your character means. Aspects can make
	the difference between a good character and a great character.
			</p>
			<p>
				Start by thinking about who your character is. A noble. What
	makes your character unique from the others you’ll meet? What 
	makes you stand apart?
			</p>
			<p>
				If you had only two things to say about your character—and each
	had to be summed up in five words or less—what would those two 
	things be? That’s a good way to start thinking about Aspects. And 
	remember, an Aspect can be a single word, a couple of words, a phrase
	an item, or even a quote. <a href="info/aspectexamples.html" target="_blank">Here</a> are a few examples to get you started.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				For mechanics, an Aspect as <b>an Invoke, a Tag, and a Compel</b>.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The Invoke</b> is explicit circumstances in which your aspect gives you an advantage of 3 bonus dice. An appropriately narrow circumstance may be "when I use a sword". 
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The Tag</b> is a weakness in your Aspect which may give a knowledgeable enemy an extra 2 bonus dice against you. An example weakness may be your overhead strike has a severe opening in you defenses.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>The Compel</b> is a certain manner, for good or ill, that your Aspect makes you act in. Anyone may Compel your Apsect to limit your behaviour. An example behaviour may be your particular code of honor compelling you to risk your own life to protect others.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most importantly, your Tags and Compels are a secret. Nobody can Tag or Compel your Aspect unless they know them.
			</p>
			<p>
				Invoking your Aspect or Tagging/Compelling another's Aspect costs one Style point. We'll get to these later.
			</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col2">
			<h3>Contacts</h3>
			<p>
				You get one Contact.
			</p>
			<p>
				All through your character’s life, he’s made important 
	connections with other nobles. Sometimes those connections 
	fade, sometimes they last for years. Each Phase, your 
	character has an opportunity to make a contact, a 
	friend or ally that lasts through the storms life throws at 
	relationships.
			<p>
				Pick another player's character for this Phase's contact.
	You both share some sort of connection, a story
	about how you met and why you became such close friends.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you like, draw a name out of a hat or make a deliberate 
	choice. Either way, you should choose a different character
	for each Phase.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not only does this build relationships with other 
	characters, but it also helps build your own history, filling 
	in details, getting input from other players, facets of your 
	character you may have never thought of yourself.
			</p>
				Mechanical benefits for having Contacts are many. For
	example, you may spend style points to refresh a contact’s 
	Aspects and trading resources and goods are easier with a 
	contact. As we go through the rules, you’ll see other places 
	where contacts provide advantages you’ll want in the game.
	Keep an eye out for them.

		<h2>Devotions</h2>
		<div id="devotions">
		<p>
			You have three points of Devotion to divide amongst your Ancestors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Your Ancestors play a large role in this world. When they die, their legacies live on and
			they becomes symbols, patron saints of their virtues. Those strongly devoted to their
			Ancestors even attest to communicating with them in visions or dreams. There are many
			Ancestors, often overlapping in their worshipped attribute.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many Ancestors are surrounded by a sect of devoted followers, a cult of mystery. Joining
			these cults allows you to learn the secrets of that Ancestor's life. The more you know,
			the more you know how to communicate with them. You learn symbols associated with them,
			surround yourself with those symbols, and attune yourself to their slumbering conciousness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, if you show your Ancestor the proper respect, reverence and adoration (like bringing 
wine and flowers to their shrines), they return your kindness with Blessings. These 
are supernatural gifts that benefit your character in specific ways. You can read all about 
the Blessings in <b>chapter ___________!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>.
		<p>
		</p>
			You can have an Ancestor of swords, an Ancestor of bridges, of gardening, or of just about anything.
			You may not have an Ancestor of “winning rolls”. That would be lame. Bad form.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following are 6 major Ancestors. You may choose to divide your Devotion among 
them. You have three points of Devotion to give these Ancestors, each point increasing 
your Devotion to them by one rank. For example, if you put two points toward 
______!!!!!!!!!!, your Devotion to the Falcon’s Friend is rank 2. If you put one point 
toward __________!!!!!!!!, your Devotion to Old One-Eye is rank 1.

		<h2>Domain</h2>
		<div id="domain">
		<p>
			It’s time to determine what Regions and Vassals your noble owns.
		</p>
		<p>
			A Domain is a vague stretch of land with various geographical features. Strange
			oddities, such as deserts next to forests or tundras next to mountains, are not
			uncommon in strange lands due to the powerful sorcerer-kings of old. Your Domain
			is all the land you hold.
		</p>
		<p>
			You begin the game with five points for Regions and five points for Vassals.
		</p>
		
		<div class="col1">
			<h3>Regions</h3>
			<p>
				The standard unit of land is a <b>Province</b> which is made of <b>ten Regions</b>.
				A Region generally represents some geographical feature such as a mountain range, a
				farmstead, or a forest.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a beginning character, your Domain is not completely explored. You own a 
	Province and within that Province are ten Regions, but not all the Regions are yet under 
	your control. You must take some effort to expand your control so your Domain comes 
	completely under your thumb.
			</p>
			<p>
				For free you get two discovered Regions: your Castle and your Village. After that
				you need to spend one of your five starting Region points to discover a Region.
				You may also invest one point in your Region to increase it's Rank.
			</p>
			<p>
				When a Region is explored, it becomes Rank 1 and you must pick one resource for
				it to produce. At Rank X, it will provide you with X of those resources. For example,
				if you spend a point to discover a Forest and then invest another point into it then
				you have a Rank 2 Forest which produces either 2 Food or 2 Lumber for you.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="col2">
			<h3>Vassals</h3>
			<p>
				Vassals are skilled professionals who help you with your Season Actions. Each has
				an upkeep cost of at least 1 Food per Year but the more you pay them the less likely
				they are to be bribed by enemies.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you are Married then you automatically get a Rank 1 Spouse Vassal. Remember to
				name your Vassals, whether they be individuals or groups!

		<h2>Style</h2>
		<div id="style">
			<p>
				Your character starts with <b>three Style points</b>. There 
all kinds of things you can do with Style points. You 
can read about how to earn and spend them in the 
Risk chapter. But, for right now, just know that you 
have three.
			<p>
				At the end of each game session,
you may any remaining Style points to a maximum of five unless a rule states otherwise.
All unbanked Style points will be lost at the end of the session.
			</p>
		</div>
		
		<br/>
		<h2>Bonus Points</h2>
		<div id="bonus_points">
			You get <b>five Bonus points</b>. They buy you a little something extra from
			the following categories and you may not spend more than 3 in a single category.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Aspect</b> - You may buy new Aspects to a limit of half your Wisdom, rounded up</li>
				<li><b>Contact</b> - You may buy an additional Contact. You may choose NPCs with Narrator permission</li>
