	<h1>Setting up the game</h1>
	<h2>Player Creation</h2>
	<p>Flip over 3 more species cards then there are players. Players somehow determine which races they want and the other 3 become NPC races.</p>
	<p>As you pick your race, draw 2 random cards from the creation deck. These cards represent a great fate dealt to your species and you decide how they dealt with it. Your decision ripples throughout history, bestowing a minor trait to your species. When you determine the NPCs, somehow determine 1 trait for each of them.</p>
	<h2>Galaxy Creation</h2>
	<p>Somehow set up the galaxy appropriately from the tile deck. This involves placing the 3 NPC races on planets. Place each player on their homeworld along with their starting fleet as dictated by their species.</p>
	<p>Randomly pick 3 tokens for each of the 5 technology tiers as well. These will represent the technologies available to all players in this game.</p>


	<h1>Playing the game</h1>
	<h2>Play Order</h2>
	<p>At the game's start, somehow pick a starting player and go clockwise. The order from then on will be the order that players folded on their turn, from the first to the last.</p>
	<h2>Taking Actions</h2>
	<p>On each turn you have 3 actions: a Major Event, a Minor Event, and a Move Event. Alternatively, your Major Event can be traded in for two Minor events, resulting in three Minor Events and a Move Event on your turn.</p>
	<div class="pad-left">
		<p>Major Events can be used to engage in <a href="#" id="battles-b">Battles</a> or advance to new <b>Technology</b>.</p>
