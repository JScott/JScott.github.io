				<div class="title">PROBLEM</div>
				<p>
					I was getting frustrated with a lot of Bioware RPGs and wanted to make a game that tackled my core problems with them:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Cognitive dissonance between action and choice</li>
					<li>Unreasonable time investment required</li>
				</ul>
			</article>
			<article class="one-third process">
				<div class="title">PROCESS</div>
				<p>
					Research and development was my main focus. The project necessitated unique game design	and quick development. A lot of self-learning and an old C#/XNA game engine laid the framework I needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					I couldn't do it all on my own though. I worked with a <a href="http://brightprimate.tk/">chiptune musician</a> I found on the internet and reached out	to <a href="http://icarus.jvscott.net/reviews.htm">many journalists</a> to get the word out. There was a lot of communication involved for the final product.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article class="one-third results">
				<div class="title">RESULTS</div>
				<p>
					In 6 months I created and released a game that:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Determined your choices by your actions</li>
					<li>Delivered a succinct story in a 15 minute playthrough</li>
					<li>Utilized procedural terrain generation to drive engagement</li>
					<li>Explored power themes through unique combat mechanics</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					While not a commercial success, there were hundreds of downloads and half the proceeds went to <a href="http://www.childsplaycharity.org/">Child's Play</a>.

					TELUS' navigation needed improvement and the search had been stagnant for 4 years. I was allowed to take on this task in a 5 month timeframe.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article class="one-third process">
				<div class="title">PROCESS</div>
				<p>
					I wrote a Java application from scratch, using REST services for fetching results. HTML5 and CSS3 were used to code an excellent front-end experience.
				</p>
				<p>
					The TELUS visual brand, UX standards, and approval process were closely followed to gain stakeholder support. This became vital when championing Google site search and the organizational change required.

				<div class="title">RESULTS</div>
				<p>
					I was able to deliver a page which improved the navigation across telus.com and telusmobility.com. I was given personal recognition for my efforts by both the team's Director and VP.
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, this was a great personal learning	experience as both a Project Manager and Developer.

				<div class="title">PROBLEM</div>
				<p>
					3D platforming games are taking a notable turn away from exploration. The focus is on linear challenges or puzzles which are fun but not what I want. I've made a couple attempts at making a game that rewarded exploration just as much as it rewarded progression.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article class="one-third process">
				<div class="title">PROCESS</div>
				<p>
					Two attempts were made at the same game, first in C#/XNA and later in Unity3D/Javascript.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the major components was developing a free-floating camera that intelligently takes the best shot. There are a lot of cool little details like y-axis stabilization and momentum leading.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, the core of it was <a href="http://www.errantsignal.com/blog/?p=243">developing "kinaesthetics"</a>. A lot of effort went into making the gameplay system feel great and giving a sense of occupying space to bring the world to life.
				</p>
			</article>
			<article class="one-third results">
				<div class="title">RESULTS</div>
				<p>
					The first attempt was a proof of concept to myself with a self-imposed deadline. Development wasn't quick enough to warrant continuing until my second attempt in Unity3D. I had more reasonable goals the second time but a full-time job made it frustrating to make the progress I needed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite not reaching full product, the engine development has been a very enlightening set of experiences. I look forward to getting the itch in the future and returning to it.
