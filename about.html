		The path of a developer is a perilous one and requires a passion for creating smart, elegant solutions. Stay and while and listen.
	<p>
	<h2>Call to Adventure</h2>
	<p>
		As a young boy I was drawn to experiments and creating things, expressing my questions and creativity through drawings and games. Then one	day my parents bought me Interplay's Learn to Program BASIC and my fate was sealed.	By day I would learn C/C++ and by night I would play games that let me create worlds. I even briefly dabbled in the dark arts of VRML!
	</p>
	<h2>Road of Trials</h2>
	<p>
		But children grow up quickly and I followed my dreams in Computing Science at	Simon Fraser University. I focused on the complex math needed for graphics programming and exercised my leadership and interpersonal skills as President of the SFU Dance Club. After only 5 years of study I had my degree.
	</p>
	<h2>Master of Two Worlds</h2>
	<p>
		With these foundations in place, I joined the workforce at TELUS as a black ops dev rotating between teams. I performed redesigns of internal tools, gaining a reputation as the front-end go-to guy. I embraced DevOps culture and evangelized automation, empowering my coworkers. I excel with the responsibility and freedom to do great things and strive for ethical, open-source development.
	</p>
	<p>
		And so the devs, designers, and VPs alike rejoiced as the legacy code was slain. <a href="mailto:jvscott@gmail.com">Get in touch with me</a> and I'll share some of my many other stories. I do a lot of stuff, including singing and guitar, and I love to tell a good story.
