	<p class="lead intro">
		The path of a developer is a long and perilous one and requires a passion for creating smart, elegant solutions. Let me tell you my story...
	<p>
	<h2>Call to Adventure</h2>
	<p>
		As a young boy I was drawn to experiments and creating things, expressing my questions and creativity through drawings and games. Then one	day my parents bought me Interplay's Learn to Program BASIC and my fate was sealed.	By day I would learn C/C++ and by night I would play games that let me create worlds. I even briefly dabbled in the dark arts of VRML! 
	</p>
	<h2>Road of Trials</h2>
	<p>
		But young boys grow up quickly and I followed my dreams in Computing Science at	Simon Fraser University. I focused on the complex math needed for graphics programming and exercised my communication skills as President of the SFU Dance Club. After only 5 years of study I had my degree.
	</p>
	<p>
		A degree doesn't make a developer though, and I had plans to differentiate myself with a return to games. I designed and developed Icarus, an ambient platformer with unique mechanics, from start to finish. This was a great learning experience that received quite a bit of <a href="http://icarus.jvscott.net/reviews.htm">press</a>.
	</p>
	<h2>Master of Two Worlds</h2>
	<p>
		With these foundations in place, I joined the workforce at TELUS. For a year I worked on and supported various tools in developer and project manager capacities. Sharing my knowledge with the team, I quickly gained a reputation as the go-to guy for front-end development and opportunities.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finding the same passion that I had for games in web development, I made the case for and worked on the project to redesign the search for our external web properties. Given the responsibility and freedom, I personally implemented best HTML5/CSS3 and UX practices while presenting changes to stakeholders.
	</p>
	<p>
		And so the outdated application was slain and customers and VPs alike rejoiced.	Get in touch with me and I'll share some of my many other stories. I do a lot of stuff, including singing and guitar, and I love to tell a good story.
